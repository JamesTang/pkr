ToDo:

1. figure out what we want the site to do

2. figure out how to store the data

3. make the data model

4. make the object model

5. make the wire frames

6. make a rudimentary timeframe for when stuff will be done, and who is doing it

some ideas for #1:

game theory generator.  sounds complicated, but any easy thing to do.  based on pot odds, determine the percentage of time that a certain action should be done (say bluffing the river) to make it non-exploitable.  then run a random-number generator that uses the calculated percentage to determine if we should bluff this time.  input should be say...pot size and bet size.  output should be game-theory optimal percentage, and a YES/NO decision.

basic poker statistic aggregator.  track VPIP (voluntarily put money in pot), preflop raise, 3bet percentage, etc etc.
